# Experimental Add-on to use PHP patch versions: ddev-php-patch-build

[DDEV](https://ddev.com) users periodically ask if they can use a specific PHP patch version with their projects, either to test/compare for a particular bug or to match a production version exactly.

This **experimental** add-on tries to address that need, although there are a number of caveats:

1. The build done using this process uses the technique from [static-php-cli](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli) and full details are available there. It supports all the versions supported in the upstream repository, currently PHP 7.3-8.4.
2. The build does not match the build done using the official DDEV php packages (which actually come from [deb.sury.org](https://deb.sury.org/).
3. It currently does not provide xdebug, see [extension support](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extension-notes.html).
4. The resultant PHP binaries built here do not have the exact same extensions as the official DDEV PHP binaries.
5. Building the binaries happens in the build phase of `ddev start`, and it takes a long time on the first `ddev start` or whenever you change versions. My tests on Gitpod, with a great internet connection, took about 8-9 minutes. It can be really annoying, and a better way to build would be an improvement.
6. If you want to see the build process as it proceeds, you can use `ddev debug refresh` or `DDEV_VERBOSE=true ddev start`.
7. When you use this add-on, your DDEV `php_version` setting is ignored.
8. To see what's going on during the build, use `ddev debug rebuild -s web --cache`
9. Your mileage may vary.

* The [static-php-ci](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli) repository provides a relatively easy way to build static PHP binaries (the CLI and `php-fpm`) which can be used to replace the ones installed in `ddev-webserver`.
* The provided Dockerfile.php-patch-build does the building.
* The provided `config.php-patch-build` provides post-start hooks that install the built binaries.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get rfay/ddev-php-patch-build
ddev restart
```

You can choose a different PHP version, the command below creates a `.ddev/.env.php-patch-build` file that you can commit:

1. `ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.php-patch-build --static-php-version=8.0.10`
1. `ddev add-on get rfay/ddev-php-patch-build`
2. `ddev restart`

## Components of the add-on

* `config.php-yaml`
* `Dockerfile.php-patch-build`
* A test suite in [test.bats](tests/test.bats) that makes sure the service continues to work as expected.
* [Github actions setup](.github/workflows/tests.yml) so that the tests run automatically when you push to the repository.
